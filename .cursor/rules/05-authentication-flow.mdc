# Authentication Flow

This project uses Supabase for authentication with Next.js middleware for protected routes.

## Auth Implementation

- [middleware.ts](mdc:middleware.ts): Handles authentication checks on protected routes
- [components/auth](mdc:components/auth): Contains auth-related components like login/signup forms

## User Session Management

- Supabase Client: Used for handling authentication state
- Server-side session validation using Supabase SSR utilities
- Client-side auth state management with React context

## Protected Routes

- Protected routes check for authenticated users via middleware
- Unauthenticated users are redirected to login pages
- Role-based access control for specific features

## Auth Components

Key authentication components:

- Login form: Email/password and social login options
- Signup form: New user registration
- Password reset: Forgot password flow
- Account settings: User profile and account management
