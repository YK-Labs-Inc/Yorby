Okay, I've got the start:

*   **Project Name:** Perfect Interview

*   **Technology:** Next.js
*   **Features:**

    3.  Interview copilot feature which is a tool that listens in on interviews in real time and then answers questions based off of the user's previous work experience and other context the useruploads. Lives in dashboard/interviewCopilot path.
