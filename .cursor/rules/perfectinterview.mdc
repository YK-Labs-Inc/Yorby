Okay, I've got the start:

*   **Project Name:** Perfect Interview
*   **Purpose:** A suite of tools to help people land jobs.
*   **Technology:** Next.js
*   **Features:**
    1.  Resume Builder (using a chat interface) — lives in dashboard/resumes path
    2.  Interview Prep Question Tool (generates questions based on job description and user's uploaded work experience) — lives in dashboard/jobs path
    3.  Interview copilot feature which is a tool that listens in on interviews in real time and then answers questions based off of the user's previous work experience and other context the useruploads. Lives in dashboard/interviewCopilot path. 
    4. User knowledge base: Perfect Interview stores a knowledge base about the user's career/work history so that whenever we create a resume/interview prep material/interview copilot, we always have the context of the user's previous work history to create personalized content for the user. This lives in the /knowledge-bas directory.
