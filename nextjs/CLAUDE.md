## Project Overview

Yorby is a comprehensive AI-powered recruitment and interview preparation platform with two main products:

### 1. AI Recruiter for Businesses (B2B)

An AI-powered recruitment platform that helps businesses scan, assess, and interview candidates more efficiently and equitably:

**Core Functionality:**
- **Job Listing Creation**: Companies create job postings hosted on Yorby
- **Custom Interview Questions**: Recruiters upload interview questions specific to each role
- **AI-Powered Interviews**: Every candidate who applies goes through an AI interview instead of just submitting a resume
- **Voice-to-Voice Interaction**: Uses LiveKit technology for real-time voice conversations between candidates and AI interviewer
- **Automated Analysis**: AI analyzes interview performance and provides scores categorizing candidates as strong, median, or weak performers
- **Equitable Screening**: Replaces resume-based screening with actual interview performance assessment

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Company Management**: Organizations with team member roles (owner, admin, recruiter, viewer)
- **Candidate Pipeline**: Track applicants through stages (applied → screening → interviewed → reviewing → offered/rejected)
- **AI Interview Analysis**: Comprehensive performance analysis including:
  - Hiring verdict (Advance/Reject/Borderline) with match score
  - Question-by-question breakdown with quality scores
  - Identified strengths and concerns with evidence from responses
  - Job requirement alignment (matched/missing/exceeded)
  - Interview recordings with Mux video player integration
  - Full transcript with timestamps
- **Application Management**: Resume and document uploads with preview/download capabilities

### 2. AI Interview Preparation (B2C)

A candidate-facing platform for AI-powered interview preparation:

**Core Features:**
- **Job Description Upload**: Candidates upload job descriptions to generate relevant practice questions
- **Resume & Work History Integration**: Upload resumes and work documents for personalized question generation
- **Personalized Practice Questions**: AI generates tailored interview questions based on the specific job and candidate's background
- **Individual Question Practice**: Practice questions one-by-one with AI feedback on answers
- **Full Mock Interviews**: Complete AI-powered mock interview sessions using the same technology as the business recruiting platform
- **Performance Feedback**: Detailed analysis and suggestions for improvement

#### Technical Architecture:

**Database Schema**:
- `companies`: Organization profiles with slugs
- `company_members`: User-company relationships with role-based access
- `company_job_candidates`: Candidate applications and status tracking

### State Management

Context providers handle global state:

- `UserProvider` - Authentication state
- `MultiTenantProvider` - Coach/tenant logic
- `DeepgramContextProvider` - Voice processing
- `ReferralProvider` - Referral tracking

### Environment Variables

Key required variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_OR_PUBLIC_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_OR_SECRET_KEY`
- `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`
- `MUX_TOKEN_ID` / `MUX_TOKEN_SECRET`
- `MUX_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - For verifying Mux webhook requests
- `LIVEKIT_API_KEY` / `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET` - For real-time voice interviews
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEKIT_URL` - LiveKit server URL

### Development Considerations

1. **Authentication**: All protected routes require Supabase authentication
2. **File Uploads**: Use Supabase Storage or Google Cloud Storage
3. **AI Features**: Monitor token usage for cost management
4. **Video/Voice Processing**: 
   - Mux webhook handlers for async processing of recorded interviews
   - LiveKit integration for real-time voice-to-voice AI interviews
5. **Real-time Communication**: LiveKit handles voice streaming and processing
6. **Candidate Experience**: Non-authenticated candidates can complete interviews via public application flow
7. **Company Access**: Role-based permissions (owner, admin, recruiter, viewer) for business features
8. **Performance**: Use composite indexes and SWR for optimized data fetching
9. **Interview Analysis**: AI-generated comprehensive reports with structured feedback
10. **Testing**: Limited test coverage - only typewriter component has tests

### Next.js App Router

This is a Next.js application using the App Router paradigm:

- All routes are defined in the `/app` directory
- Server Components are the default
- Client Components require the `"use client"` directive
- API routes are colocated in `/app/api` directories

### Logging with Axiom

The application uses Axiom for structured logging via the `next-axiom` package:

**Server Components and Server Actions**:

- Import `Logger` from `next-axiom`
- Example: `import { Logger } from "next-axiom"`
- Use `log.info()`, `log.error()`, `log.warn()` methods
- **IMPORTANT**: When initializing the logger, always use the `with()` function and pass a JSON object containing the function name and its parameters

**Client Components**:

- Use the `useAxiomLogging` hook from `@context/AxiomLoggingContext.tsx`
- Example: `const { logInfo, logError, logWarning } = useAxiomLogging()`
- Automatically includes userId in all logs

**Route Handlers**:

- Use `req.log` from the `AxiomRequest` object
- Example: `req.log.info("Processing request", { endpoint: "/api/example" })`
