## Project Overview

Yorby is a comprehensive AI-powered recruitment and interview preparation platform following an open core model with two main products:

### 1. AI Recruiter for Businesses (B2B)

An AI-powered recruitment platform that helps businesses scan, assess, and interview candidates more efficiently and equitably:

**Core Functionality:**
- **Job Listing Creation**: Companies create job postings hosted on Yorby
- **Custom Interview Questions**: Recruiters upload interview questions specific to each role
- **AI-Powered Interviews**: Every candidate who applies goes through an AI interview instead of just submitting a resume
- **Voice-to-Voice Interaction**: Uses LiveKit technology for real-time voice conversations between candidates and AI interviewer
- **Automated Analysis**: AI analyzes interview performance and provides scores categorizing candidates as strong, median, or weak performers
- **Equitable Screening**: Replaces resume-based screening with actual interview performance assessment

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Company Management**: Organizations with team member roles (owner, admin, recruiter, viewer)
- **Application Tracking System (ATS)**: Configurable candidate pipeline stages with:
  - **Custom Stage Management**: Companies can create, edit, delete, and reorder application stages
  - **Default Stages**: Every company starts with 7 default stages (Applied, Screening, Interviewed, Reviewing, Offered, Rejected, Hired)
  - **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Visual stage reordering with real-time candidate count display
  - **Candidate Status Tracking**: Real-time status updates with stage progression tracking
  - **Smart Deletion**: Automatic candidate reassignment when deleting stages with existing candidates
- **AI Interview Analysis**: Comprehensive performance analysis including:
  - Hiring verdict (Advance/Reject/Borderline) with match score
  - Question-by-question breakdown with quality scores
  - Identified strengths and concerns with evidence from responses
  - Job requirement alignment (matched/missing/exceeded)
  - Interview recordings with Mux video player integration
  - Full transcript with timestamps
- **Application Management**: Resume and document uploads with preview/download capabilities

### 2. AI Interview Preparation (B2C)

### Next.js App Router

This is a Next.js application using the App Router paradigm:

- All routes are defined in the `/app` directory
- Server Components are the default
- Client Components require the `"use client"` directive
- API routes are colocated in `/app/api` directories

### Logging with Axiom

The application uses Axiom for structured logging via the `next-axiom` package:

**Server Components and Server Actions**:

- Import `Logger` from `next-axiom`
- Example: `import { Logger } from "next-axiom"`
- Use `log.info()`, `log.error()`, `log.warn()` methods
- **IMPORTANT**: When initializing the logger, always use the `with()` function and pass a JSON object containing the function name and its parameters

**Client Components**:

- Use the `useAxiomLogging` hook from `@context/AxiomLoggingContext.tsx`
- Example: `const { logInfo, logError, logWarning } = useAxiomLogging()`
- Automatically includes userId in all logs

**Route Handlers**:

- Use `req.log` from the `AxiomRequest` object
- Example: `req.log.info("Processing request", { endpoint: "/api/example" })`
