# Application Tracking System (ATS) Feature

## Overview
We are implementing a free, open-source, customizable application tracking system similar to Notion's stage management, where companies can manage candidate application stages throughout their hiring pipeline.

## Requirements
- **Company-level customization**: Each company can customize their own stages
- **Notion-like flexibility**: Start with sensible defaults, allow full customization
- **Simple individual operations**: Focus on moving individual candidates between stages
- **No stage constraints**: Candidates can move freely between any stages
- **Backend/database focused**: Initial implementation covers database schema only

## Database Schema Changes

### New Tables

#### `company_application_stages`
Main table storing customizable stages per company:

```sql
company_application_stages:
- id (uuid, primary key, default: gen_random_uuid())
- company_id (uuid, not null, references companies.id)
- name (text, not null) - e.g., "Applied", "Interviewing"
- description (text, nullable)
- order_index (integer, not null) - for stage ordering
- color (text, nullable) - hex color for UI
- created_at (timestamp, default: now())
- updated_at (timestamp, default: now())

Constraints:
- UNIQUE(company_id, name) - prevent duplicate stage names per company
- UNIQUE(company_id, order_index) - prevent duplicate ordering
```

### Modified Tables

#### `company_job_candidates`
- **Removed**: `status` field (was free text)
- **Added**: `current_stage_id` (uuid, references company_application_stages.id, NOT NULL)

## Default Stages
Every company starts with these 7 default stages:

1. **Applied** (#3B82F6) - Candidate has submitted their application
2. **Reviewing** (#F59E0B) - Application is being reviewed by the team  
3. **Interviewing** (#8B5CF6) - Candidate is actively interviewing
4. **Offer Extended** (#059669) - Job offer has been extended to candidate
5. **Hired** (#047857) - Candidate has accepted the offer and been hired
6. **Offer Declined** (#F97316) - Candidate declined the job offer
7. **Rejected** (#DC2626) - Application has been rejected

## Automation
- **Trigger function**: `create_default_application_stages()` automatically creates default stages for new companies
- **Trigger**: Fires after INSERT on `companies` table
- **Existing companies**: Migration seeds default stages for all existing companies
- **Existing candidates**: All set to "Applied" stage by default

## Row Level Security (RLS)
- Company members can manage their company's application stages
- Same permission model as other company resources
- Policy: Company members with accepted invitations can view/modify stages

  - Full CRUD operations for application stages
  - Drag-and-drop reordering with visual feedback
  - Real-time candidate count display using SWR
  - Delete confirmation with candidate reassignment handling
  - Form dialogs for creating/editing stages with color picker
  - Handles edge cases (last stage deletion, candidate reassignment)

- **Stage Header Component**: `app/recruiting/companies/[id]/stages/CompanyStageHeader.tsx`
  - Navigation breadcrumb back to company dashboard
  - Internationalized header with company context

- **Server Actions**: `app/recruiting/companies/[id]/stages/actions.ts`
  - `validateCompanyAccess()`: Company membership verification
  - `getCompanyStages()`: Fetch stages for a company
  - `createStage()`: Create new application stage
  - `updateStage()`: Update existing stage details
  - `deleteStage()`: Delete stage with optional candidate reassignment
  - `getStageCandidateCount()`: Count candidates assigned to a stage
  - `updateStageOrders()`: Batch update stage ordering

### Candidate Management Integration
- **Enhanced Candidate List**: `app/recruiting/companies/[id]/jobs/[jobId]/candidates/CandidatesList.tsx`
  - Updated to display candidate stages with color-coded badges
  - Real-time stage tracking integration
  - Integrated candidate status filtering with URL state persistence

- **Client Wrapper Component**: `app/recruiting/companies/[id]/jobs/[jobId]/candidates/CandidateClientWrapper.tsx`
  - SWR-based data fetching for candidates, stages, and counts
  - Handles loading states and error recovery
  - Provides candidate selection and stage update functionality

- **Candidate Status Component**: `app/recruiting/companies/[id]/jobs/[jobId]/candidates/CandidateStatus.tsx`
  - Interactive dropdown for changing candidate stages
  - Real-time stage updates with optimistic UI
  - Color-coded stage display with visual indicators
  - SWR mutation for stage changes with error recovery

- **Enhanced Candidate Info**: `app/recruiting/companies/[id]/jobs/[jobId]/candidates/CandidateInfoSection.tsx`
  - Integrated candidate status component
  - Real-time stage change handling

- **Candidate Status Filter Component**: `app/recruiting/companies/[id]/jobs/[jobId]/candidates/CandidateStatusFilter.tsx`
  - Multi-select dropdown filter for viewing candidates by application stages
  - Real-time stage data fetching with SWR integration
  - URL state management for filter persistence
  - Interactive UI with color-coded stage indicators and selection counts

- **Updated Server Actions**: `app/recruiting/companies/[id]/jobs/[jobId]/candidates/actions.ts`
  - `updateCandidateStage()`: Update individual candidate stage assignments
  - `getCompanyStages()`: Fetch stages for dropdown population
  - Enhanced candidate data fetching with stage information

### Features Implemented
- **Visual Interface**: Clean card-based UI with color indicators and drag handles
- **Real-time Updates**: SWR integration for live candidate counts and stage changes
- **Drag & Drop**: Visual reordering with immediate feedback
- **Smart Deletion**: Automatic candidate reassignment when deleting stages
- **Interactive Stage Changes**: Dropdown interface for instant candidate stage updates
- **Candidate Status Filtering**: Multi-select dropdown filter with "All stages" option, individual stage selection, and URL state persistence
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback with error recovery for stage changes
- **Form Validation**: Required field validation and error handling
- **Internationalization**: Full i18n support via `next-intl`
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging with Axiom
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators and disabled states
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface
- **Color-coded Stages**: Visual stage identification throughout the candidate pipeline

### Internationalization Updates

  - Added status-related translations for stage display
  - Includes "noStage" fallback for candidates without assigned stages
  - New filter-specific translations section `filters`:
    - `allStages`, `filterByStage`, `clear`, `selectAll`
    - `stagesSelected`, `selectedCount` for multi-selection display
  - Consistent messaging across the candidate pipeline interface

## Future Considerations (Not in Scope)
- Stage history tracking (`candidate_stage_history` table)
- Bulk candidate operations
- Automated stage transitions/notifications
- Job-specific stage overrides
- Stage movement constraints/validation

## Usage Patterns
- **Stage Management**: Companies can add/remove/reorder stages through visual drag-and-drop interface
- **Individual Candidate Movement**: Recruiters can move candidates between stages via dropdown interface
- **Candidate Filtering**: Multi-select filter to view candidates by specific stages or view all candidates
- **Real-time Updates**: Stage changes reflect immediately across the application with SWR
- **Visual Customization**: Stage names and colors can be customized per company needs
- **Ordered Pipeline**: Order index allows for proper stage progression display in candidate views
- **Context Information**: Description field provides context for each stage
- **Candidate Status Tracking**: Visual badges show current candidate stage throughout the recruiting interface
- **Filter State Persistence**: Filter selections persist in URL parameters for shareable filtered views

## Key Design Decisions
- **Simplified approach**: No stage categories (initial/in_progress/final) - just names
- **No audit trail**: No history tracking to keep initial implementation simple
- **Company-scoped**: Stages belong to companies, not individual jobs
- **Flexible movement**: No constraints on stage transitions
- **Automatic setup**: New companies get defaults immediately via trigger
- **Client-side optimization**: SWR for real-time updates and optimistic UI
- **Component separation**: Clear separation between stage management and candidate tracking
- **Visual feedback**: Immediate UI response with error recovery patterns
