# Internationalization (i18n)

This project supports multiple languages through Next.js internationalization features.

## Implementation

- Uses next-intl for internationalization
- [app/[locale]](mdc:app/[locale]): Locale parameter in the URL path
- [i18n/](mdc:i18n): Directory containing translation files

## Supported Languages

- English (default)
- Other supported languages based on translation files

## Localization Pattern

- Text is never hardcoded in components
- Translation keys are used with the next-intl hooks/components
- Dynamic content is formatted according to locale

## Usage

- Use the `useTranslations` hook to access translations
- Format dates, numbers, and currencies based on locale
- Handle RTL languages when applicable
- Translation script in [scripts/translate.js](mdc:scripts/translate.js)
